---

## ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

The Tkinter application will open and you can enter the mobile specifications to generate a price prediction.

---

## 🧪 Model Training

If the model needs to be trained again, run:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

The training process generally includes:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Cleaning the data
3. Selecting relevant features
4. Splitting data into training and testing sets
5. Training the Linear Regression model
6. Evaluating the model
7. Saving the trained model

Feature Preparation
    ↓
Trained Linear Regression Model
    ↓
Prediction
    ↓
Estimated Mobile Price
```

---

## 💡 Example

For example, a user can provide specifications such as:

```text
RAM: 8 GB
Storage: 128 GB
Battery: 5000 mAh
Camera: 50 MP
```

The trained model processes these features and returns an estimated mobile price.
